# DES Algorithm Optimization

**Author**: argc_xiang WHU

This project focuses on the optimization of the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm. The goal is to improve its performance by employing various optimization techniques in areas such as lookup tables, memory alignment, loop unrolling, and data structure design. Below is a detailed explanation of the optimizations implemented.

## **Optimizations Overview**

### **1. Lookup Table Optimization**
Precomputed lookup tables are used to minimize runtime calculations:
- **`IP_LOOKUP`**, **`FP_LOOKUP`**, **`E_LOOKUP`**, **`P_LOOKUP`**: Precomputed tables for initial permutation (IP), final permutation (FP), expansion (E), and permutation (P).
- **`SBOX_RESULT`**: A precomputed table for S-box results.
- Each entry in the lookup tables includes precomputed byte indices and bit masks, eliminating the need for runtime calculations.

### **2. Loop Unrolling**
To reduce loop overhead, macros are used to replace loops:
- **Subkey Generation**:
  - Loop unrolling for PC1 (Permuted Choice 1) and PC2 (Permuted Choice 2) processes.
- **IP and FP Permutations**:
  - Initial permutation (IP) and final permutation (FP) operations are unrolled to improve execution speed.

### **3. Memory Alignment Optimization**
Memory alignment ensures efficient access to data in memory:
- **Aligned Attributes**:
  - Data is aligned using attributes like `aligned` to ensure proper memory alignment, leading to improved memory access efficiency.

---

### **4. Bit Operation Optimization**
Bitwise operations are employed to replace lookup and arithmetic calculations:
- **Precomputed Mask Values**:
  - Avoid runtime calculation of mask values by precomputing them.
- **Shift Operations**:
  - Replace expensive division and modulo operations with bitwise shift operations for better performance.

### **5. Inline Functions**
Inline functions are used to reduce the overhead of function calls and improve instruction-level parallelism.

---

### **6. Compiler Optimization Hints**
Hints are provided to the compiler to enable optimizations:
- **Loop Unrolling Directives**:
  - Compiler hints are used to suggest unrolling of critical loops for better performance.

---

### **7. Macro Reuse**
Macros are utilized to reduce code duplication and improve readability:
- Repeated logic is replaced with macros for cleaner and maintainable code.

---

### **8. Memory Operation Optimization**
Optimized memory operations are used to minimize overhead:
- **`memcpy` and `memmove`**:
  - These functions are used for efficient memory copying.
- **Temporary Buffers**:
  - Proper use of temporary buffers reduces redundant memory copying.

---

### **9. Data Structure Optimization**
Improved data layout and packing strategies are applied:
- **Struct Packing**:
  - Lookup table entries are grouped into structures for efficient access.
- **Cache-Friendly Layout**:
  - Data is arranged to enhance cache performance and minimize cache misses.

---

### **10. Branch Optimization**
Branching is minimized to avoid prediction failures:
- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - Conditional branches are replaced with bitwise operations where possible.
- **Unrolled Loops**:
  - Unrolling reduces the number of branches and improves branch prediction accuracy.

## **Optimization Objectives**
The above optimizations focus on the following aspects:
1. **Minimizing runtime calculations**: Use precomputed values to save computation time.
2. **Improving memory access efficiency**: Optimize data alignment and caching behavior.
3. **Reducing branch prediction failures**: Minimize branching and improve CPU pipeline performance.
4. **Leveraging CPU caching**: Arrange data and operations to maximize CPU cache utilization.
5. **Reducing function call overhead**: Inline functions and macros reduce call overhead.
